# Introduction to the TellusR Framework

Welcome to the TellusR framework, a collection of essential libraries that our team utilizes in our own projects to streamline development processes and enhance functionality. This framework has been designed with practicality in mind, providing developers with tools that simplify complex tasks and promote efficiency.

The first module we would like to introduce is **Tellusr-SearchIndex**. This lightweight Kotlin wrapper around Apache Lucene is crafted to make the definition, indexing, and searching of domain models straightforward—eliminating the need for developers to write intricate Lucene-specific code. 

**Tellusr-SearchIndex** is particularly useful for applications requiring full-text search capabilities, offering a way to maintain robust search functionalities while keeping data local and deployment hassle-free. Supporting both Java 21 and Kotlin 2.1, this library facilitates easy management of records through designated fields and schemas, encouraging a self-documenting structure.

Key features of **Tellusr-SearchIndex** include CRUD operations, flexible search capabilities, and customizable options, making it a versatile choice for your development needs. For more details and access to the module, please visit the [Tellusr-SearchIndex GitHub repository](https://github.com/TellusR/tellusr-searchindex).

We hope that this framework will enhance your development experience and provide the tools you need to build effective and user-centric applications.
