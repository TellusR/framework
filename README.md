# Introduction to the TellusR Framework

Welcome to the TellusR framework, a collection of essential libraries that our team utilizes in our own projects to streamline development processes and enhance functionality. This framework has been designed with practicality in mind, providing developers with tools that simplify complex tasks and promote efficiency.

We hope that this framework will enhance your development experience and provide the tools you need to build effective and user-centric applications.


### Tellusr-SearchIndex

**Tellusr-SearchIndex** is a lightweight Kotlin wrapper designed around Apache Lucene, simplifying the process of defining, indexing, and searching domain models without the need for writing Lucene-specific code. This library is particularly beneficial for applications that require full-text search capabilities but want to avoid the complexity of external database systems. By utilizing embedded Lucene, **Tellusr-SearchIndex** offers robust search functionalities, ensuring that data remains local and deployment is straightforward.

The library supports **Java 21** and **Kotlin 2.1**, and allows for easy management of records through designated fields and schemasâ€”facilitating a self-documenting structure. Key features include CRUD operations, flexible search capabilities, and advanced customization options.
